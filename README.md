👋 Hi, I’m Hillary! I'm a Senior Product Manager at Kickstarter, a crowdfunding platform for creative projects. In the past, I've also worked as a PM in other fields, namely edtech (Cengage) and staffing software (Erecruit, which has since been aquired by Bullhorn). Prior to working in tech, I started out my career with a brief stint as a high school English teacher.
